\section{Introduction}

The potential of memristor crossbar arrays (CBAs) for in-memory computation has been explored in many research works \cite{CAMPBELL201710, Strukov_Snider_Stewart_Williams_2008, Zou_Xu_Chen_Yan_Han_2021}. For artificial neural network (ANN) applications, CBAs can accelerate multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) in the analog domain \cite{Crafton_West_Basnet_Vogel_Raychowdhury_2019, Ielmini_2016}. Additionally, ANN operations such as the activation function require additional supporting circuitry \cite{Sun_Ielmini_2022}. In this paper, a memristor-based hardware design is proposed for accelerating important ANN operations in the analog domain. The hardware is centered around a dual CBA approach to represent the synaptic weights. The neuron consists of circuitry to perform the activation functions that can be configured for Sigmoid, Leaky-Relu, and Tanh function behaviours. The CBAs and the supporting circuitry are simulated in a SPICE backend and interfaced to a Python abstraction layer API. Additionally, since the CBA is a passive component, special consideration has been taken to reduce loading effect and noise in the circuit design.
