The abstract goes here. What you need to do is to
insert your abstract here. Please try to make it less than 150
words. We suggest that you read this document carefully before
you begin preparing your manuscript. IEEE does not want
conference papers to have keywords so you should remove your
keyword list. Also, at this time, IEEE only has some general
guidelines about the format for conference papers. It is up to
each individual conference to decide which format to use. In
order to have a uniform look for all papers published in the
CEC 2007 Proceeding, we require that every author follow the
format of this sample paper. This sample paper is for latex
users. Authors may use the sample paper here to produce their
own papers by following the same format as this sample paper.
