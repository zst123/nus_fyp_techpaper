    The goal of this research is to design a memristor-based hardware accelerator to perform in-memory computations of common neural network operations. Memristor RRAM crossbar arrays (CBAs) are used to accelerate neural network operations by performing matrix multiplications in the analog domain. In this work, the circuit architecture of the hardware accelerator is derived. The circuit functionality is simulated and verified through a SPICE backend. For validation, a MNIST classification architecture is generated, and the performance of the accelerator is evaluated by characterising the circuit noise behaviour to form a noisy neural network model. Finally, a statistical analysis is done to assess the feasibility of scaling up the CBA for larger neural networks.
